Nazrah aspires to bridge the gap between Independent filmmakers in Egypt and across the world.

Nazrah Films was founded right after
the Egyptian Revolution against the
old regime in 25th of January 2011\.
With the changes swiping the Middle
Eastern society and especially in
Egypt, new rights and freedoms are
emerging.
Independent Cinema strives to take
place in the new democratic Egypt,
Searching for the true meaning and
practice of democracy, also as a
counter track to the monopoly of the
commercial Cinema that do not
represent the new generation of
filmmakers or the new democratized
Egyptian society. We want to change
the status quo where Independent
Cinema barely exists.
The new hopes, ambitions and visions
of the independent filmmakers yearn
for an opportunity for production and
for reaching the audiences eager for
this kind of cinema.
Nazrah Films was founded with
passion and a clear goal of
supporting independent films and
independent filmmakers. One of our
goals is reaching out to the world
through Independent Cinema as a
means of communication,
encouraging individual and authentic
voices to represent themselves.
Based on democracy, equality, and
freedom of speech, we want to
explore shared initiatives of struggling
Egyptian independent filmmakers.
